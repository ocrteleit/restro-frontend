---

## 🔧 Configuration

### Current Settings

**Kitchen Display:**

```javascript
// Auto-refresh: ENABLED (5 seconds)
refreshInterval: 5000;
```

**Analytics Dashboard:**

```javascript
// Auto-refresh: DISABLED (manual refresh only)
refreshInterval: 0;
```

### To Enable Analytics Auto-Refresh

Edit `/hooks/useAnalytics.js` line ~20:

```javascript
// Change from:
export const useDashboardAnalytics = (restaurantId = null, refreshInterval = 0) => {

// To (refresh every 30 seconds):
export const useDashboardAnalytics = (restaurantId = null, refreshInterval = 30000) => {
```

## 🌐 Backend API Requirements

The system is designed to work with these Strapi endpoints:

### Required Endpoints (already working)

```
✅ GET /api/orders (with filters and populate)
✅ GET /api/payments (with filters)
✅ GET /api/tables
✅ GET /api/menu-items
✅ GET /api/categories
✅ PUT /api/orders/:id (for status updates)
```

### Optional Analytics Endpoints (not required - falls back to dummy data)

```
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/dashboard
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/revenue-chart
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/popular-items
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/sales-by-category
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/peak-hours
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/orders-by-day
⚠️ GET /api/analytics/payment-methods
⚠️ GET /api/orders/kitchen
```

**Note:** If these analytics endpoints don't exist, the system will gracefully fall back to dummy data. No errors will be shown to users.

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

Both features are fully responsive:

- **Desktop:** Full layout with all charts
- **Tablet:** 2-column grid
- **Mobile:** Single column, optimized for touch

Recommended screen sizes:

- Kitchen Display: **Large screens** (24" or bigger)
- Analytics: **Desktop or tablet** (minimum 768px width)

---

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Change Chart Colors

Edit `/components/admin/analytics-dashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
const COLORS = ["#0088FE", "#00C49F", "#FFBB28", "#FF8042", "#8884D8"];
// Change to your brand colors
```

### Change KPI Card Colors

Edit the `kpiCards` array in `analytics-dashboard.jsx`:

```javascript
{
  color: "text-green-600",     // Text color
  bgColor: "bg-green-50",      // Background color
}
```

### Customize Kitchen Display Theme

Edit `/app/admin/kitchen/page.jsx`:

```javascript
// Current: Dark theme (bg-gray-900)
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-900 p-6">

// Light theme option:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-white p-6">
```

## 🐛 Known Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Charts appear empty

**Cause:** No data from API, dummy data is empty arrays  
**Solution:** This is expected if backend analytics endpoints don't exist yet. You can:

1. Add sample data to `/hooks/useAnalytics.js` dummy data constants
2. Implement backend analytics endpoints
3. Use existing order/payment data (client-side calculations in `/lib/admin-api.js`)

### Issue: Kitchen display shows "All Clear"

**Cause:** No active orders in the system  
**Solution:** Create test orders with status: "created", "accepted", "preparing", or "ready"

### Issue: Sound notification not playing

**Cause:** Browser auto-play policy  
**Solution:** User must interact with page first, or add a notification.mp3 file to `/public/`

## 📈 Performance Optimizations

The system includes several performance features:

1. **SWR Caching** - Data is cached and reused
2. **Manual Refresh** - No aggressive auto-refresh by default
3. **Lazy Loading** - Charts load only when visible
4. **Optimized Re-renders** - React.memo on chart components
5. **Fallback Data** - Prevents empty states and errors

---

## 🚀 Production Deployment

Before deploying to production:

1. **Update API Base URL**

   ```javascript
   // In /lib/api.js
   export const API_BASE_URL = "https://your-production-api.com/api";
   ```

2. **Enable Auto-Refresh (Optional)**

   - Kitchen Display: Already enabled (5s)
   - Analytics: Consider enabling for real-time KPIs

3. **Add Error Tracking**

   - Install Sentry or similar
   - Track API failures
   - Monitor chart rendering issues

4. **Optimize Images**

   - Ensure menu item images are optimized
   - Use CDN for faster loading

5. **Test on Target Devices**
   - Test kitchen display on actual kitchen screens
   - Verify analytics on tablets/mobiles
